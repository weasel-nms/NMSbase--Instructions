# Importing bases in No Man's Sky using NMSbase files

Anyone playing No Man's Sky on PC (Steam, Xbox Store, GoG) can import base templates using a save editor.  Why would someone import a base designed by someone else instead of making their own?
- Some people just like exploring or other game aspects and don't feel like spending time on basebuilding
- Some people just don't get the spatial relations and in-game mechanics of placing parts
- Some people like making bases, but find glitch building to be daunting
- Some people would like expanded building options offered by modding, but can't for some reason (such as modding being difficult on Xbox Store)

If any of these restrictions apply to you, you still deserve nice-looking No Man's Sky bases.  If you can run a No Man's Sky save editor and know how to copy and paste text, then you can import a base.

## Setting up
You'll need two things to import a base:
1. A downloaded base template file (.nmsbase)
2. A No Man's Sky save editor with JSON editing abilities.  Both [NMSSE](https://github.com/goatfungus/NMSSaveEditor) and [NomNom](https://github.com/cengelha/NomNom) work for this purpose, but NMSSE's JSON editor is more fully featured at the time of writing, and will be used in these instructions.

## Instructions
1. Download a base template (.nmsbase).  Open the file in Notepad, select all text with CTRL-A, and copy all text with CTRL-C.

3. Check the readme for the NMSbase file.  It will provide guidance on where the starting base computer must be located.
